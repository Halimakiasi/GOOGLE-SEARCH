                extinct Pleistocene wolf. Dogs were
                the first species to be domesticated by hunter gatheres over 15,000 years ago, before development of agriculture. Due to their long
                association with human being, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained ability to thrive on a starch
                rich diet that would be in-adequate for other canids.
